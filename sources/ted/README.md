## Tenders Electronic Daily

What major purchases have the European governments made recently? Who
are the most prominent contractors? What kinds of services do they 
provide?

This parser toolkit will extract contract award information from the
combined European procurement system, Tenders Electronic Daily (TED).

#### Features

The site will break down procurement information over a variety of 
dimensions. The key dimensions are: 

* Purpose (based on the Common Procurement Vocabulary, CPV)
* Geography (based on countries, NUTS codes and addresses)
* Supplier (i.e. contract grantee)
* Authority (i.e. public body or quasi-public organisation)
