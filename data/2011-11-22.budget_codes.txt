<p>Part of this appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on the following measures:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">promoting the availability in Europe of mechanisms for securing access to credit for SMEs, such as credit guarantee consortia, and analysing credit market issues where necessary,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">supporting credit applications to financial institutions submitted by such consortia of SMEs, inter alia through the provision of secondary guarantees by the European Investment Fund (EIF),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">concluding agreements with financial institutions on subsidised loans to credit guarantee consortia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Poor access to appropriate forms of finance is frequently quoted as a main barrier to entrepreneurship and enterprise innovation. This problem may be exacerbated by new accounting standards which will make banks more sensitive to risk and lead to a rating culture. The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme addresses persistent recognised market gaps leading to poor access to equity, venture capital and loans for SMEs, through Community Financial Instruments operated on behalf of the Commission by the EIF, the Union&#8217;s specialised institution for providing venture capital and guarantee instruments for SMEs.</p>

<p>Under the Multiannual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship, independent evaluations identified the market-based approach and the implementation via the EIF of these instruments as a best practice. They are therefore continued and adapted in the new programme.</p>

<p>The Community Financial Instruments for SMEs ease the supply of capital for innovative start-ups and young companies.</p>

<p>The High Growth and Innovative SME Facility (GIF) will share risk and reward with private equity investors providing important leverage for the supply of equity to innovative companies. The GIF instruments increase the supply of development equity for innovative SMEs in their early stages and in the expansion phase, leveraging &#8216;follow-on&#8218; capital to help them bring their products and services to market and continue research and development activities, including those regarding eco-innovation.</p>

<p>The SME Guarantee Facility continues to provide counter or co-guarantees to guarantee schemes operating in eligible countries, and direct guarantees to financial intermediaries. It concentrates on addressing market failures: (i) in the access of SMEs with growth potential to loans (or loan substitutes such as leasing); (ii) in the provision of microcredit and (iii) in access to equity or quasi-equity. A (iv) new securitisation window mobilises additional debt financing for SMEs under appropriate risk-sharing arrangements with the targeted institutions.</p>

<p>A Capacity Building Scheme is intended to support the capacity of financial intermediaries to focus on additional investment and technology aspects. Action will also be undertaken to facilitate SME financing in countries where banking intermediation is significantly lower than the EU average.</p>

"02.02.12","Pilot project - Facilitating access to insurance by self-employed builders and small building firms so as to stimulate innovation and the promotion of eco-technologies in the European Union","<p>The development of energy-saving techniques and renewable energy use is an issue of major importance to the building industry. With 2,5 million firms, a turnover of more than EUR 1 200 billion and a workforce of 12 million people, 9,7 million of whom are waged employees, the building industry generates 10&#160;% of the Union&#8217;s GDP. 99&#160;% of building firms are SMEs (with fewer than 250 employees), which generate 78&#160;% of the industry&#8217;s turnover. Increased use of eco-technologies and eco-innovations in the building trade is, however, dependent on a combination of factors, such as additional cost, product availability, consumer demand and skill levels within firms.</p>

<p>Another major problem hampering more widespread use of these new technologies is access to insurance by building firms, particularly the smaller firms which, in Europe, make up more than 90&#160;% of the building industry. Owing in particular to their size and financial base, small firms find it difficult to insure construction or renovation work involving the use of new technologies (solar, photovoltaic, geothermal, etc.). In practice, this acts as a barrier to the spread of eco-technologies by small firms, which account for more than 60&#160;% of production in Europe. The difficulties which self-employed builders and small building firms experience in obtaining insurance covering new eco-technologies is clearly acting as a barrier to more widespread use of those technologies.</p>

<p>The European Union therefore needs to introduce an instrument that will provide effective support for small building firms, which are of central importance to the attainment of the Union&#8217;s targets for the use of renewable energy (20&#160;% of gross internal consumption by 2020).</p>

<p>The aim of this project is therefore to create an EU/Community financial instrument that will, over a limited period, make it easier for small building firms to gain access to construction insurance when using eco-technologies in building projects.</p>

<p>The budget heading, which could come under the operational management of the EIF, should be subject to strict conditions for the disbursement of funds for specific insurance companies in order to facilitate the provision of insurance cover to building firms using eco-technologies. The project would therefore be based on the same formula as existing EU/Community schemes to foster the development of SMEs and innovation (risk capital/loan guarantees).</p>

<p>Small firms would not, of course, receive Union funding directly; instead support would be provided through insurance cover, supplementary insurance cover or a reinsurance scheme. The scheme to facilitate access to construction insurance by small firms could be subject to various provisos, such as:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">only firms below a given size and turnover would be eligible,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">only specific types of work (involving eco-technologies) and specific contracts or projects of a limited size would be covered,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">only limited or flat-rate cover for claims would be provided.</p>
</li>
</ul>","Pilot project within the meaning of Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."
"02.02.13","Preparatory action - Opportunities for internationalisation of SMEs","<p>The global economy is witnessing a qualitatively new form of international economic relations resulting in new opportunities for SMEs in an international environment. Some of the reasons for seeking new markets might be:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">local markets are smaller in scope,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">national markets stagnate at certain times,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">access to international markets in pursuing high-growth objectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of the Small Business Act (SBA) providing for business support programmes and transnational research, SMEs should be involved in transnational projects to take advantage of the growth in markets outside the Union. The approach might lead to potential enhancing of the skills and innovative strategies giving a competitive edge to European SMEs. This preparatory action is aimed at testing the involvement of SMEs in such actions and providing the necessary information in order to develop a strategy at a later stage. The preparatory action will involve a detailed feasibility study to assess the market potential and appropriate business support measures for SMEs in key international markets. The study will examine the different options and tools available to better connect European SMEs to these markets, and propose country-specific measures to facilitate access to these markets by European SMEs in the future.</p>","Preparatory action within the meaning of Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."

<p>These activities should promote and support intermodal barrier-free mobility for persons with reduced mobility (PRMs).</p>

<p>In connection with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91 (OJ L 46, 17.2.2004, p. 1), the Commission needs to develop additional measures to make enforcement of the Regulation more efficient.</p>

<p>These actions and objectives could be supported at different levels (local, regional, national, European and international), for all transport modes and sectors and related to transport, as well as in technical, technological, regulatory, informative, environmental, climatic, political fields and for sustainable development.</p>

<p>Air transport has long been one of the sectors in which the consumer authorities receive most complaints in the European Union. The increase in the number of commercial transactions performed electronically (using the Internet or a mobile telephone) has merely resulted in more breaches of European consumer legislation.</p>

<p>One of the main complaints by EU consumers is that there are no effective means of redress at airports themselves, particularly when disputes arise as a result of failure on the part of airlines and other service providers to meet their obligations. The European consumer and air transport authorities therefore need to work together to secure an immediate improvement in passenger support and information facilities at airports and, at the same time, step up coregulation in the sector.</p>

<p>Part of this appropriation will be used to establish a pilot project to set up an integrated air passenger support system at European Union airports, based on a single helpdesk and information system that is shared and maintained by all the stakeholders at European level. This will provide passengers with a guarantee that, whichever EU airport they are in, any complaints or requests for information that they make will be dealt with in the same manner, with support being provided by the local consumer authorities and coordinated through the information networks already in place within the EU.</p>","Task resulting from the Commission’s prerogatives at institutional level, as provided for in Article 49(6) of the Financial Regulation."
"06.02.06","Marco Polo II programme","<p>This appropriation is intended to cover expenditure on implementation of a programme to promote alternatives to international road haulage, designated &#8216;Marco Polo II&#8218;.</p>

<p>The Marco Polo II programme proposes five kinds of measures to achieve its objectives:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">modal transfer actions to transfer, in the short term, a major share of road traffic to other less saturated transport modes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">catalyst actions which enable structural market barriers to be overcome through the implementation of new innovative services,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">common learning actions with a view to improving cooperation, sharing of know-how and knowledge development in the logistics industry,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">actions to provide high-quality logistic services based on short sea shipping which will be comparable to motorways and therefore called &#8216;motorways of the sea&#8218;,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">traffic avoidance actions involving an active role for manufacturing industry and logistics systems within one coherent strategy to develop sustainable operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The transport infrastructure networks of the newest Member States are not at this stage in a position to serve the increased post-enlargement trade flows; in such cases intermodal transport solutions constitute the best response and there is thus huge scope for Marco Polo II as a continuation and strengthening of the successful Marco Polo I programme.</p>

<p>The support for commercial action in the market for freight transport services is different from the support given through research and development programmes and the trans-European network programme. Marco Polo II will foster modal shift projects in all segments of the freight market, not only in combined transport.</p>

<p>A number of Member States have taken measures individually in this respect; therefore, numerous examples both of good and of bad practice exist, alongside interdisciplinary studies and suggestions, based on but not limited to assessing damage caused by modern intensive agricultural practices and climate change-related issues.</p>

<p>According to reports from the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Malta, Latvia, Hungary, Romania, Turkey and Belarus, as well as other countries and regions in the European Union and across Europe, are facing this major environmental and economic problem, and &#8216;business as usual&#8218; scenarios show that agricultural productivity is expected to drop even further in the next few years, thus threatening the security of food supply.</p>

<p>Moreover, desertification results not only in agricultural losses, but also in loss of biodiversity, reduction in soil fertility and reduction in the capacity of soil to retain water, increased erosion and reduced carbon capture. Furthermore, floods and droughts linked to climate change are becoming more frequent and more drastic in their effects, increasing to an even greater extent the risk and negative economic and social consequences of desertification (see paragraph 17 of the European Parliament resolution of 9 October 2008 on addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union (Texts adopted, P6_TA(2008)0473)).</p>

<p lang=""en"">awareness-raising campaigns with and between Member States, candidate countries, and western Balkan and ENP countries, as well as other stakeholders facing this environmental and economic problem, with the aim of helping to maintain vegetation cover and surface and underground moisture levels, thus decreasing aridity and halting desertification,</p>

"07.03.17","Preparatory action - Climate of the Carpathian basin","<p>The main aim of the project is to investigate the detailed weather-related and spatial structure of the Carpathians and the Carpathian basin with integrated or at least comparable methods. The basic results will be a contribution to regional climate variability and change studies, and applied climatology. The climate of the region has not been described as a geographical unit for about 90 years.</p>

<p>National meteorological measurement networks have different instruments and often different regulations. Accurate climate field modelling needs larger areas, but smaller countries cannot be used as a model for reproducing the climate of neighbouring regions. These factors make comparison between national maps impossible. Additionally, some countries have national climate atlases already, while some do not. The project will collect information on the measurements and on the existing databases. The next step is the development of climate maps by exchanging data and information. In parallel with that, data quality and standardisation methods will be compared. It is suggested that a mapping method be used for which there is no need for large amounts of data to be exchanged between countries. The scale of the project will be enlarged to include the south-eastern Europe (SEE) region at the next stage in collaboration with the parallel SEE climate mapping project, the precursor of which was the &#8216;Summer School on Preparation of Climate Atlas&#8218; organised by the Hungarian Meteorological Service (http://www.met.hu/pages/seminars/seeera/index.htm).</p>

<p>The climate of the Carpathians and the Carpathian basin is fundamental input information for weather and climate forecasting. The Carpathians Environment Outlook project (under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) umbrella), Danube (seventh European corridor) and the Carpathian basin cover a large part of the watershed area. What will be produced will be common maps and comparable national climate and meteorological maps, and there will be a possibility of enlarging the scope of the project, plus a database of gridded maps for other future large projects.</p>

"09.03.01","Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme - Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP)","<p>The ICT PSP is one of the three specific programmes under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP). It is a new legal instrument in the context of the 2007 to 2013 financial framework.</p>

<p>Actions will be stepped up at EU level for stimulating wider uptake of ICTs. Synergistic actions at EU level aim to reduce uncertainties and the risks of duplication by sharing and replicating experiences and lessons learned and foster the internal market dimension of services triggered by ICTs promoting interoperability and combating fragmentation. They aim also to stimulate the regulatory and technological environments necessary to promote innovation and to overcome potential barriers (e.g. cultural, linguistic, technical, legal and disability- or &#8216;dys&#8218; condition-related).</p>

<p>As indicated in the legal basis, the ICT Policy Support programme shall provide for the following actions: </p>

<p>(a) development of the single European information space and strengthening of the internal market for ICT products and services;</p>

<p>(b) stimulation of innovation through a wider adoption of and investment in ICTs;</p>

<p>(c) development of an inclusive information society and more efficient and effective services in areas of public interest, and improvement of the quality of life, particularly for persons with disabilities and persons suffering from &#8216;dys&#8218; conditions (dyslexia, dyspraxia, dysphasia, dyscalculia, etc.).</p>

<p>This will be done in particular by supporting the development of ICT-based services and the development and use of digital content in areas of public interest, including in the areas of ICT for Health and Inclusion; ICT for Government and governance; ICT for energy efficiency, smart mobility and environment; digital libraries, better exploitation of public sector information, education and learning. </p>

<p>Part of ICT PSP appropriations in the CIP may be used to ensure testing, and support deployment across the EU, of the next-generation 112, innovative services for interoperable emergency services and 112 for all citizens, enabling quicker, more efficient reactions and life-saving, inter alia through remodelling the traditional technical architecture for emergency calling and lowering its cost and complexity, with the ultimate aim of providing an optimum response to 112 calls made by all citizens, including users with disabilities.</p>

<p>The ICT PSP in the CIP will stimulate wider uptake of ICT for improved services. It will ensure also that European businesses and in particular SMEs can benefit from the new opportunities brought by the increasing demand for these ICT-based services. As indicated in the CIP legal basis, the support to the development and use of digital content is fully integrated in the ICT PSP from 2009 on. During a transition phase for 2007 and 2008, this has been done under the eContent plus programme (through its own legal basis).</p>

<p>The main part of the support will go to a limited number of high-impact pilot projects and best practice actions per year. Accompanying measures, such as thematic networks bringing together a variety of stakeholders around specific objectives, will be also launched. They will be complemented by the monitoring of the European information society, by measures providing the background knowledge that is needed for policy decision-making, and by actions for promoting and raising awareness of the benefits brought by ICT to citizens, businesses (in particular SMEs) or public organisations.</p>

The specific programme &#8216;Capacities&#8218; under the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities aims to enhance research and innovation capacity throughout Europe through the emergence and reinforcement of multidisciplinary European poles of excellence. In particular, research infrastructures play a key role in supporting the creation of knowledge, its dissemination, application and exploitation, thus fostering innovation.</p>

<p>This activity addresses more specifically the deployment of ICT-based infrastructures, or e-infrastructures. These provide services to research communities by bringing the power of distributed ICT-based resources (computing, connectivity, storage, data and instrumentation) to virtual communities. The reinforcement of a European approach in this domain establishes synergies between national infrastructures or initiatives, ensures that critical masses are reached, rationalises new investments, and strives for world leadership. It can make a significant contribution to boosting European research potential and its exploitation, and consolidating e-infrastructures as a cornerstone of the European Research Area, a &#8216;forerunner&#8218; of cross-discipline innovation and a driver in changing the way science is conducted.</p>

<p>The Solvit system has proved to be one of the most effective out-of-court dispute settlement mechanisms.</p>

<p>It can effectively and efficiently deal with problems faced by citizens or businesses, arising as a result of the misapplication of internal market legislation by a public administration in another Member State. Furthermore, the Solvit system is able to produce feedback information by using an online database system which is accessible to all coordination centres and to which citizens and business can directly submit their problems.</p>

<p>However, Solvit like many other public assistance services relating to EU issues is still not widely known among potential users of the system. At the same time citizens and businesses are often very confused about the right address for their requests for information, assistance or problem solving. To remedy this, the Commission has announced, as part of the single market review, that it will endeavour to create a single web-based access point guiding citizens and business to the right service. This single access point should be implemented by the end of 2010. The European Commission shall inform the competent committee of the European Parliament in a yearly report about the frequency of use of the contact point and possible measures to further improve it.</p>

<p>Member States should be urged to take appropriate measures to notify their citizens about the provision of such a single contact point. </p>

<p>Moreover, in its May 2008 action plan on Single Market Assistance Services a range of actions was proposed to increase cooperation between the existing assistance services so that they can offer a better, faster and more streamlined overall service to citizens and businesses.</p>

<p>Promotion of all these services also needs to take place in a more coordinated way to avoid citizens and businesses being confused by too many brand names.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Commission shall inform the competent committee of the European Parliament about the concrete measures which have been undertaken in this field.</p>","Task resulting from the Commission’s prerogatives at institutional level, as provided for in Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."

<p>The aim of the proposed Convention for Urban and Rural Europe (CURE) is to offer &#8212; at the time of the mid-term review of EU programmes and financial perspectives in 2009/2010 &#8212; recommendations on policy frameworks and measures which will assist a sustainable approach to the future of urban and rural areas in Europe, achieved through effective partnership between governments and civil society.</p>

<p>The convention process will enable European citizens and stakeholders to contribute to the revision and design of European policies concerning sustainable rural-urban relations. It is designed to bring together rural and urban interests through a series of thematic seminars based in different European regions and European civil society networking.</p>

<p>It is envisaged that seminars will focus on one or more of a series of major themes or issues within the broad context of sustainability and territorial cohesion: either general themes, which apply equally to urban and rural areas, such as demographic and climate change, energy efficiency, food security, natural resources management, biological and cultural diversity, cohesion and social inclusion, and constructive dialogue between citizens and governments; or specifically urban or rural issues, such as rapid population growth or competition for land, loss of social services or narrow local economies. A particular focus will be the interdependence of cities and rural areas, and overarching regional or territorial solutions.</p>

<p>The process should reach a climax at a convention gathering, with the following main outputs:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">a statement of a vision for a sustainable future for urban and rural areas in Europe,</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

"13.03.21","Pilot project - Pan-European coordination of Roma integration methods","<p>The aim of the pilot project is to produce a complex analysis based on current understanding of the Roma community&#8217;s situation in the European Union, emphasising the entire complex and synergetic spectrum of education and training, beginning with pre-school children, through the further education of young mothers up to training for older people.</p>

<p>The pilot project should also reflect the proper preparation and implementation of the institutional process in terms of consultations, networking, data collection, evaluation, field visits, research, etc. A number of Member States have taken measures to promote Roma integration. Examples both of good and of bad practice are numerous, alongside a growing corpus of sociological, legal and policy-oriented research.</p>

<p>A Roma Unit could be set up to explore, from an EU policy implementation point of view, sectoral issues and propose appropriate actions and measures to be included in the proposals for a Roma Inclusion Action Plan.</p>

<p>It could also take on the task of examining cross-sector cooperation and use of the existing different financial instruments, proposing pilot projects and detecting transferable and sustainable good practice which can then contribute to producing concrete policy proposals.</p>

<p>In this context, reference can be made to the need for long-term proposals on the housing and urban development aspects (linked to issues of segregation, ghettoisation, etc., when badly prepared) in connection with innovative use of regional funds and EIB/EBRD support, or the huge issue of data collection (and protection), statistics, etc., but also the obviously related issues of combating crime and trafficking, as well as basic registration problems. </p>

<p>Particular attention has to be given to the issue of media coverage and communication in general.</p>

<p>As an essential prerequisite for success, a process of structured dialogue with Roma civil society has to be developed at local, national and EU level.</p>

<p>The European Parliament has been a pioneer in promoting Roma rights; its first resolution on the issue goes back to 1984. During the previous term, the European Parliament has adopted a number of resolutions on the specific situation of Roma in Europe. In particular, in its resolution of 31 January 2008 on a European strategy on the Roma, the European Parliament urged &#8216;the Commission to develop a European Framework Strategy on Roma Inclusion aimed at providing policy coherence at EU level as regards the social inclusion of Roma and urges the Commission at the same time to comprehensively shape a Community Action Plan on Roma Inclusion with the task of providing financial support for realising the objective of the European Framework Strategy on Roma Inclusion&#8218;. Also, in its resolution of 10 July 2008 on the census of the Roma on the basis of ethnicity in Italy, the European Parliament reiterated those requests and again called on the Commission and the Member States, within the framework of an EU Roma Strategy and in the context of the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015, to enact legislation and policies to support Roma communities while promoting their integration in all fields, to launch anti-racism and anti-discrimination programmes in schools, employment and the media and to enhance the exchange of expertise and best practices.</p>

<p>The European Parliament reiterates in this context the importance of developing strategies at EU and national level, making full use of the opportunities provided by EU funds, to abolish Roma segregation in education, to ensure equal access to quality education for Roma children (participation in mainstream education, introduction of special scholarship and trainee programmes, additional and concrete measures to promote pre-school education for Roma children and postgraduate studies at national and international level for Roma students as well as educating an effective group of &#8216;Roma diplomats&#8218; able to bridge the gap between Roma communities and public institutions), to ensure and improve Roma access to labour markets, to provide equal access to health care and social security benefits, to combat discriminatory practices in the provision of housing, and to increase the participation of the Roma in social, economic, cultural and political life.</p>

<p>The European Parliament reaffirms the need to set up a network of academic and civil experts with a clear mandate to propose specific pilot projects and elaborate projects triggering immediate changes.</p>

<p>The aim of the pilot project is also to ensure the integrated education of Roma families, focusing simultaneously on the early integration of children in pre-school education, the training of parents and the conducting of community activities for the whole family, also with a view to improving adults&#8217; passive skills.</p>

<p>In its conclusions of December 2007, the European Council, &#8216;conscious of the very specific situation faced by the Roma across the Union&#8218;, invited &#8216;Member States and the Union to use all means to improve their inclusion&#8218;. In its June conclusions, it stated that &#8216;&#8230;it looks forward to the results (&#8230;) of the forthcoming conference on this issue to be held in September. It invites the Council to take this into account in its examination of the revised Social Agenda. The European Council will return to this issue before the end of the year&#8218;.</p>

The second principle of the pilot project is that the mobility element is included in an agreed programme of on-the-spot training and sharing of experience with focus on &#8216;economic and social cohesion&#8218;.</p>

<p>Goals are:</p>

<ul><li>

By promoting the EU cohesion policy model as a success story through a number of regional dialogues, the EU will use these actions to exemplify and advance its values, fundamental principles, organisational structures and policies on a global scale.

"13.03.24","Preparatory action - Promoting a more favourable environment for micro-credit in Europe","<p>The Council has on several occasions (in 2000 and in March 2003) acknowledged the advantages of micro-finance for small firms. The European Council has, for the first time, asked Member States to pay particular attention to using micro-credit to foster the establishment and growth of small firms. Micro-credit was one of the focuses of the European multiannual programme (MAP/2002 to 2006) financial instruments which the Council adopted in December 2001, defining &#8216;micro-loan&#8218; as a loan of less than EUR&#160;25&#160;000.</p>

<p>The Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), which has been in operation since 2006, also deals with micro-credit, including under the second facility (SME Guarantee Facility).  This facility, which is administered by the European Investment Fund (EIF), seeks to encourage financial institutions to play a more important role in offering small loans, which normally carry with them proportionally high loan management costs for borrowers unable to provide adequate security. In addition to guarantees and counter-guarantees, financial intermediaries are entitled to subsidies to reduce the high administrative costs associated with micro-loans.</p>

<p>The aim of this preparatory action is to foster the development of micro-credit in Europe, in line with the new Lisbon Agenda growth and employment targets and the recommendations set out in the European Parliament resolution of 11 July 2007 on financial services policy (2005 to 2010) &#8212; White Paper, with particular reference to the need for a micro-credit action plan.</p>

<p>The purpose of the preparatory action is to:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">ensure that the micro-credit business in Europe becomes self-financing in the medium term by building up the equity of micro-finance institutions, particularly non-banking institutions. The project could be administered by the EIF, the EU financial institution which specialises in SME and micro-enterprise funding and which also administers the EU/Community financial instruments,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en""> foster greater synergy between existing financial instruments covering inter-related areas (CIP, Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (Jeremie), ERDF, EDF),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en""> foster social inclusion through entrepreneurship and the economic growth it brings. Associations working with less-favoured groups may be recipients of the funding made available.</p>
</li>

The White Paper creates a policy framework for sport at EU level, defines its specific role and values, and identifies problems and challenges. In the conclusion, the White Paper states that &#8216;the Commission may return to this issue and indicate further steps in the context of a new Treaty provision&#8218;.

<p>The objective of the preparatory action in the field of sport for 2009 was to prepare future EU actions in the field of sport with a view to implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon after ratification on the basis of priorities set in the White Paper on Sport.</p>

<p>This objective should be also pursued in 2010 with the proposed preparatory action which will contribute to identifying future policy actions in the area of sport and testing the establishment and functioning of suitable networks and good practices which can serve as a basis for a future EU programme. This preparatory action may include actions stimulating joint transfrontier sport competitions, more particularly in neighbouring regions and Member States (by merging two or three former national or regional competitions). This should ultimately provide an EU added value through the identification and dissemination of best practices and innovative approaches and through the development of comparative research. In view of the specific organisational characteristics of the sport sector, the Programme would address categories of stakeholders who are not addressed by existing EU programmes, and in particular sport organisations. It should create a critical mass by grouping together sport-related organisations and projects around specific themes.</p>","Preparatory action within the meaning of Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."

<p>EUR 1 800 000 is intended for various cross-border measures organised by the Government of the Autonomous Community of Galicia (Spain) as part of the 'Xacobeo 2010' programme.</p>

<p>EUR 2 000 000 is to be allocated for organising the 10th biannual European Youth Olympic Winter Festival (EYOWF), which is to be held from 12 to 19 February 2011 in Liberec in the Czech Republic. The Liberec will host what is an event of European importance and welcome Europe's best 1 300 young sportsmen and sportswomen from more than 45 countries, making it the largest youth sport event in the history of the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>The European Union places great emphasis on the role sport plays in education, culture, social inclusion and public health for European citizens (and has also supported European Youth Olympic Festivals in the past). In addition, Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides Europe with a legal basis to support Member States with regard to the social, educational and cultural aspects of sport. EYOWF Liberec 2011 is an excellent opportunity to highlight the role of volunteers and non-profit sports organisations in educating and bringing up European youth. Support from the EU budget will clearly demonstrate the role of the Union in this field and make it more visible.</p>

<p>EUR 6 000 000 is to be allocated to co-finance the organisation of the European Special Olympics Summer Games in Warsaw, Poland (18-24 September 2010) and to undertake the essential preparations for the World Special Olympics Summer Games in Athens, Greece (20 June &#8211; 4 July 2011). This funding will also allow participating athletes from all 27 Member States to train and prepare for and attend the games in both Poland and Greece. A further allocation should be made in the financial year 2011.</p>

<p>The European Special Olympics Summer Games in Poland will enable over 1800 people with intellectual disabilities to compete in 11 Olympic-type sports. The athletes will be supported by more than 600 coaches, 3 000 volunteers and 2 000 family members. In addition to the games, the Special Olympics organisation will conduct a public awareness campaign on intellectual disability, organise a summit for disabled and non-disabled people to become better informed and share their experiences, and organise a European university symposium which will bring together leading academics to discuss issues surrounding intellectual disability.</p>

<p>The World Special Olympics Summer Games in Greece will bring together over 7 500 people with intellectual disabilities from more than 180 countries. These athletes will be supported by 2 500 coaches, 3 000 officials, 25 000 volunteers and over 30 000 family members. Athletes will compete to the best of their abilities in 22 Olympic-type sports. In addition to the games, the Special Olympics organisation will host a global policy summit to discuss the challenges and opportunities for better social inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities. A family forum will also take place, enabling athletes' family members to learn and share experiences about raising a person with an intellectual disability.</p>","Task resulting from the Commission’s prerogatives at institutional level, as provided for in Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."

"17.03.06","Union action in the field of health","<p>The second public health programme replaces the previous programme established by Decision No 1786/2002/EC and covers the period 2008-2013.</p>

<p>The main objectives of the second public health programme are:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">to improve information on and knowledge of health: the objective is to strengthen the collection, analysis, exchange and dissemination of health-related information in Europe,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">to improve the capacity to react rapidly to health threats to protect citizens against health threats,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">to promote good health and prevent disease through action on health determinants, paying particular attention to issues linked to obesity and alcohol abuse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2008, as far as the health area is concerned, the programme has been focusing on three pillars where action at European level is essential:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Health information</em>
</p>

<p>The objective of this pillar is to strengthen the collection, analysis, exchange and dissemination of health-related information in Europe &#8212; including on disabilities and &#8216;dys&#8218; conditions &#8212; which is necessary to provide a solid foundation for health policymaking and is also needed by professionals for their work and by citizens to enable them to make healthy lifestyle choices.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Health security</em>
</p>

<p>The overall objective is to protect citizen against health threats.</p>

<p>An effective rapid response capability is needed to avoid threats to public health, for example arising from communicable diseases or chemical or biological attacks. Tackling such threats needs to be coordinated effectively at EU level. EU integration based on the principle of free movement increases the need for vigilance, in order to respond to major cross-border health threats such as avian flu, or bioterrorism.</p>

<p>(3)  <em>Promote health to improve prosperity and solidarity</em>
</p>

<p>The overall objective is to contribute to EU prosperity by fostering healthy ageing and bridging inequalities as well as to enhance solidarity between national health systems.</p>

<p>Actions will include initiatives to increase healthy life years and promote healthy ageing; explore health&#8217;s impact on productivity and labour participation; support the reduction of inequalities between Member States and investment in health, thus contributing to the Lisbon agenda, and to productivity and growth. Actions will also enhance solidarity between health systems, including cooperation on shared challenges, thus facilitating the development of a Union framework for safe, high-quality and efficient health services. Actions should also include initiatives to evaluate, by independent organisations, the quality of service provided by emergency medical services from the moment an alert is launched by citizens (e.g. through emergency call numbers) until the victim is transferred to hospital care; the aim is to help improve emergency medical services on the basis of comparable data and the identification of best practices to be exchanged between EU Member States.</p>

<p>Actions will further include the promotion of health by tackling environmental, addiction and lifestyle determinants.</p>

<p>Non-governmental organisations are key players in the implementation of the programme. Therefore, they should be allocated adequate funds.</p>

<p>Actions will also include appropriate initiatives to follow up on the recommendations obtained through the Green Paper consultation on mental health, and in particular on strategies to prevent suicide across the lifespan.</p>

<p>The objective is also for the Commission to implement the Health In All Policies strategy under the Structural Funds. Such a project should cover proposals for methods on how health issues could be incorporated &#8212; in accordance with the Health In All Policies strategy &#8212; into regional development projects. The project aims to enhance overall health in the European Union by means of capacity building in the context of regional development agencies. </p>

<p>The budget should cover training courses, international events, exchange of experiences, good practices, and international collaboration with a view to the practical use of Health Impact Assessment (HIA) both for local government and development agencies and for individuals or companies willing to apply for a grant provided by the European Union.</p>

<p>With regard to the crucial importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, they should be provided with professional support for compliance with environmental health rules, and to help them make positive changes to environmental health affecting company operation.</p>

<p>A European database on health issues and a database on environment issues should be interconnected so that further research could be improved for analysing the link between environment quality and state of health.</p>

<em>Former Article 18 03 12</em>
</p>

<p>This appropriation is intended to cover earlier commitments.</p>

<p>The purpose of the action is to test hypotheses in the field of migration management. On the basis of its evaluation, it could lead to the development of a global approach, an objective set by the European Union. The action will be based on three related components.</p>

<p>
<em>Component 1: </em>Financial assistance for the employment of immigrants returning to their countries of origin with which there are admission agreements.</p>

<p>
<em>Component 2: </em>Organising information campaigns, in countries of origin, for applicants for immigration into the European Union so as to inform them in particular about the dangers of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>
<em>Component 3: </em>Reception in dignity and solidarity &#8211; Assistance to Member States in coping with reception of irregular migrants arriving by sea. Measures would:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">assist Member States affected by sudden arrivals of migrants, e.g. by improving and exchanging good/best practices and providing interpreters and medical and legal teams,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">assist Member States to enhance reception quality and capacity, including temporary capacity, reception of irregular migrants at arrival points, e.g. by providing first aid and transport to adequate reception centres and improving/increasing reception facilities and conditions at those facilities,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">assist Member States in pooling resources to address particular pressures on their asylum systems, in particular through activities where specific expertise is needed, sharing knowledge and promoting joint approaches to address mass arrivals of asylum seekers at the external border of the Union.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For component 3, recipients of funding should be national authorities. Projects may include partnerships with other Member State authorities, international organisations and NGOs.</p>

<p>For all components, part of the appropriations should be used by the Commission to help in the management of this action (external experts, studies, etc.).</p>","Preparatory action within the meaning of Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."
"18.03.03","European Refugee Fund","<p>This appropriation is intended to finance, as regards structural measures, projects and measures concerning the reception of refugees, displaced persons and asylum applicants which meet the conditions governing eligibility for Union financial aid.</p>

<p>It is intended to support Member States&#8217; efforts to integrate refugees and other persons granted supplementary support, and to permit displaced persons a life for which they themselves are responsible, through measures taken chiefly in the following areas:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>facilitating access to employment, including vocational training,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acquisition of knowledge of the language, society, culture and institutions of the host country,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>facilitating access to housing and to the medical and social infrastructure of the host country,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support for persons in particular need of protection, such as unaccompanied minors and torture and rape victims,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integration into local structures and activities,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">improvement in public awareness and understanding of refugees&#8217; situation,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>analysis of the situation of refugees in the European Union,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">training on gender issues and child protection for officials, healthcare workers and police officers at reception centres,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>separate accommodation for single women and girls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it is intended to support efforts of the voluntary burden sharing operations by Member States, such as the resettlement, reception and integration by Member States of refugees coming from third countries and recognised by UNHCR and transfers of applicants and beneficiaries of international protection from one Member State to another which grants them equivalent protection.</p>

<p>Part of this appropriation will be used for supporting the Member States in direct cooperation with United Nations humanitarian and other agencies which on a voluntary basis extend resettlement in a flexible manner in acute refugee situations. The focus will be on the most vulnerable groups and cases where other durable solutions are regarded as having been ruled out.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be given to when the appropriation can be used to demonstrate a significant and tangible act of solidarity at European level which can produce added value as part of a broader approach on delivery of humanitarian support to a country or region.</p>

<p>At the Commission&#8217;s initiative, this appropriation is also intended to cover transnational actions or actions of interest to the Union as a whole (EU/Community actions) concerning asylum policy and measures applicable to the target population of the Fund, in particular to offer adequate support to joint efforts by Member States to identify, share and promote best practices and establish effective cooperation structures in order to enhance the quality of decision making.</p>

<p>This appropriation is also intended to cover earlier commitments from ERF I and II, including those regarding voluntary repatriation.</p>

<p>It is also intended to finance an EU/Community action to compile data for collaboration and exchange of best practices among childcare workers in closed detention centres for asylum seekers and immigrants.</p>

<p>A solidarity mechanism will be established to facilitate the voluntary reallocation of refugees and beneficiaries of international protection from Member States which are facing severe pressure from immigration flows to other Member States. The mechanism would be established at EU level and brought into operation on a trial basis so that it may eventually be continued under a Common European Asylum System. Member States would freely determine all aspects of the selection process on a voluntary basis. The Commission would set the framework, issue guidelines, encourage participation and facilitate management and coordination.</p>

<p>The mechanism should be established in line with the European Council Conclusions of 18/19 June 2009. The Conclusions note that, in view of the present humanitarian emergency, concrete measures need to be quickly put in place and implemented. The European Council called for the coordination of voluntary measures for internal reallocation of beneficiaries of international protection present in the Member States exposed to specific and disproportionate pressures and highly vulnerable persons and welcomed the intention of the Commission to take initiatives in this respect starting with a pilot project. </p>","Decision No 573/2007/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 May 2007 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows‚ (OJ L 144, 6.6.2007, p. 1).

Appropriations are used to provide, in a specific and complementary way, technical and financial assistance for third countries to support them in these efforts.</p>

<p>The EU/Community programme for the cooperation with non-EU countries and regions of origin and transit has the objective of fostering the links between migration and development, as well as to mitigate the brain drain from south to north in the process, to promote well-managed labour migration, to fight illegal migration, to fight smuggling and the trafficking of human beings and facilitate re-admission, to protect migrants and to help third countries to improve their capacities to fulfil their international obligations in the field of asylum and migration.</p>

<p>This EU/Community cooperation programme will finance appropriate actions which will join in a coherent way national and regional EU/Community cooperation and development strategies regarding the non-EU countries concerned and complete the actions &#8212; in particular in the fields of migration, asylum, border control, refugees and displaced people &#8212; provided for in the implementation of these strategies and financed from other EU/Community instruments in the field of cooperation and development.</p>

<p>This thematic programme must fully take into account new forced migrations due to climate change.</p>

<p>The respect of democratic principles and the rule of law, as well as of human rights and of fundamental freedoms, will constitute an essential element for the application of this instrument. If necessary, and as far as possible, the actions financed will be associated with measures aimed at strengthening democracy and the rule of law and the compliance with international instruments in this field, including the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.</p>

<p>Partners eligible for financial support under this appropriation may include regional and international organisations and agencies (in particular, United Nations agencies), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or other non-State actors, federal, national, provincial and local governments of third countries, their departments and agencies, institutes, associations and public and private operators.</p>

<p>Possible income, coming from financial contributions from Member States and other donor countries, including in both cases their public and parastatal agencies, or from international organisations to certain external aid projects or programmes financed by the Union and managed by the Commission on their behalf, pursuant to the relevant basic act, may give rise to provision of additional appropriations. These amounts arise from the contributions according to Article 6&#160;3&#160;3 of the statement of revenue, which constitutes assigned revenue according to Article 18(1)(aa) of the Financial Regulation. The amounts entered on the line for administrative support expenditure will be determined by the contribution agreement for each operational programme with an average not exceeding 4&#160;% of the contributions for the corresponding programme for each Chapter.</p>

<p>Appropriations under this article are subject to evaluations as established in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006. These evaluations shall include aspects of input activities and chain of results (output, outcome, impact). The findings of the evaluations shall be used in the formulation of subsequent measures financed with these appropriations.</p>","Regulation (EC) No 491/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing a programme for financial and technical assistance to third countries in the areas of migration and asylum (Aeneas) (OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 1).

"21.08.02","Coordination and promotion of awareness on development issues","<p>
<em>Action A: coordination</em>
</p>

<p>Budget financing provides the Commission with the means of support it needs to prepare, formulate and follow up coordination measures under its development policy. Policy coordination is crucial to the consistency, complementarity and effectiveness of aid.</p>

<p>Coordination measures are essential in defining and shaping European development policy at a strategic and programming level. The specific nature of European development policy is directly enshrined in the Treaties (Articles 208 and 210 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). Community/EU aid is complementary to the national policies of the Member States in the sphere of development cooperation and complementarity cannot work without coordination. Article 210 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the Commission to act as coordinator of national policies and coordinator of EU objectives with national objectives in the area of development cooperation and assistance.</p>

<p>Coordination is not only a major factor in the Commission&#8217;s value added vis-&#224;-vis the policies of the Member States but also a priority in the work schedule at the point where the agendas of the European Union and the international community intersect. It therefore reflects a steadily growing demand from the other European institutions, as recognised by the Member States and by the European Parliament at the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002.</p>

<p>This appropriation covers various forms of action:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, impact and viability studies in the area of coordination,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meetings of experts and exchanges between the Commission and Member States,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring of operations in the course of implementation,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support measures to improve the quality of the monitoring of ongoing operations and the preparation of future operations,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>measures to support external initiatives in the sphere of coordination,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the preparation of common positions, statements and initiatives,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the organisation of events relating to coordination,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">dissemination of information through the production of publications and the development of information systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Action B: raising awareness</em>
</p>

<p>This appropriation covers the financing of activities designed to draw attention to action by the EU and the Member States in the development field and to raise public awareness of development issues. Every activity financed under this Article must include the following two components, which are complementary in the Commission&#8217;s view:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>an &#8216;information&#8218; component, designed to promote the various activities which the EU undertakes in the development aid field and the activities which it conducts in partnership with the Member States and other international institutions,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">an &#8216;awareness-raising&#8218; component, covering public opinion in the EU and in the ACP States (78 countries). These activities are targeted primarily at the young. An immediate priority of this component is also to raise public awareness in the Member States about the EU&#8217;s action in the development cooperation field.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These activities consist mainly, though not exclusively, of financial support for schemes in the audiovisual, publications, seminars and events fields as applied to development, the production of information material, the development of information systems, and also the Lorenzo Natali prize for journalism in the development field.</p>

<p>These activities are directed at public and private sector partners, and at the EU&#8217;s representations and delegations in the Member States, the accession countries and the ACP States.</p>

<p>Moreover, the appropriation will cover the financing of actions within the initiative &#8216;Mobilising European Research on Development Policies&#8218;. The main output of this initiative is the publication on an annual basis of a &#8216;European Report on Development&#8218; (ERD). This process will enhance synergies between European research and policymaking by bringing them together in one common project. The ERD report, together with other intermediary products (background papers, seminars and workshops), will play a catalytic role in strengthening and refining the European vision on development and its influence in the international development agenda. This initiative is financed jointly by the Commission and by Member States through contributions on voluntary basis.</p>

"02.02.08.03","Preparatory action - Social tourism in Europe","<p>
<em>Former Article 04 03 08</em>
</p>

<p>Society is facing major change regarding industry and recreation. The advent of new family structures and emergence of single-person households, increased free time, increased life expectancy and population ageing in general, and increasing insecurity for young people, whether or not they are in employment, are all factors profoundly altering the tourism environment. Ensuring universal access to holidays means, at Union level, taking account of the specific features of European society.</p>

<p>The European Union must therefore equip itself to realise that objective. One response is based on developing social tourism.</p>

<p>Social tourism is known, firstly, for what it seeks to do: allowing as many people as possible to go on holiday. Accordingly, it aids mobility. Social tourism also has another purpose, however, which, to date, has been inadequately evaluated: regional development &#8212; many tourism association facilities are located in the countryside or in highland areas &#8212; and local development. Social tourism is therefore the proof that there is indeed an intermediate sector between the &#8216;leisure market&#8218; and the non-solvent economy. It proves that economic significance is not incompatible with accessibility for the greatest number.</p>

<p>Social desegregation must therefore be combined with local development. In promoting access for groups for which going on holiday has progressively been made a difficult or even impossible undertaking, social tourism strengthens the tourism industry's earnings capacity. It enables off-season tourism to be developed, particularly in regions where tourism is highly seasonal. Accordingly, social tourism encourages the creation of longer-lasting jobs in the tourism sector by making it possible to extend them beyond the tourist season.</p>

<p>Implementing this project (named Calypso) would be a genuine opportunity to promote partnerships, spurred on by the Commission, between the public and private sectors and the social economy. Through exchanges between European citizens and, in particular, the creation of synergies, this project would make a very great contribution towards establishing European citizenship. It should be pointed out in this connection that nearly 40 % of all trips for more than four nights are made abroad.</p>

<p>The sector is therefore important in terms both of the economic impact resulting from the number of jobs and of civic resources.</p>

<p>The beneficiaries of this measure could therefore be private firms operating in the tourism sector and carrying out the tasks described above, social tourism associations, works councils, transport firms, local and regional authority tourism associations and solidarity associations, but also commercial operators too.</p>

<p>The measures could involve:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">cataloguing and disseminating measures helping to bring about deseasonalisation as a result of the social policy function of tourism,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">devising arrangements enabling particular target groups (e.g. senior citizens, young people and families in difficult social circumstances) to go on holiday on the basis of accommodation offers by public authorities (national, regional or local), charitable organisations or any not-for-profit association.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Calypso 2010 programme objectives are based on the measures identified within the 2009 study (through a call for tender), that is to:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">catalogue the main (most representative) good practices as a means to encourage tourism activity particularly during the off-peak season, thus generating employment opportunities when tourism demand is traditionally low,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">identify the existing measures at European and national level allowing the exchanges of persons from the following target groups: senior citizens, young people, citizens with disabilities and families facing difficult social circumstances,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">examine the difficulties related to such exchanges whilst proposing the most appropriate solutions,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">propose one or several mechanisms in the tourist low season enabling particular target groups (senior citizens, young people, citizens with disabilities and families facing difficult social circumstances) to go on holiday in other Member States/candidate countries on the basis of themed programmes and accommodation offers coordinated by Member States/candidate countries authorities (national, regional or local public authorities), on the basis of initiatives from stakeholders that include municipalities, charitable organisations, parishes, unions, social partners, cooperatives or any not-for-profit association.</p>

"05.01.04.08","Sustainable agriculture and soil conservation through simplified cultivation techniques","<p>The United Nations Environment Programme contends that more than a quarter of the planet&#8217;s agricultural land has become degraded since the Second World War. Between 10 and 15 million hectares are currently lost each year.</p>

<p>In Europe, soil degradation and erosion is probably the most significant environmental problem caused by conventional agriculture, seriously affecting close to 157 m ha (16 % of Europe, i.e. almost three times the total area of France). The average soil erosion rate in Europe (17 tonnes per ha per year) is much higher than the average soil formation rate (1 tonne per ha per year). Most European Union countries are affected by this problem. In the Mediterranean regions, soil erosion is highly pronounced and may affect up to 50 to 70&#160;% of agricultural land. Intensification of conventional agriculture (increased mechanisation and ploughing) over the last 50 years has contributed to this trend, increasing the risk of desertification in most vulnerable regions. Erosion has a major economic impact on the agricultural land concerned, but also on local public infrastructure because of the cost of maintaining water systems and water treatment.</p>

<p>There is reduced biodiversity in conventional agriculture because soil left bare for a lengthy period no longer provides food and shelter for wildlife at critical times. However, production systems which leave surface residues help to restore and maintain various types of wildlife (e.g. birds and small mammals).</p>

<p>Sustainable agriculture is a set of techniques designed to allow farming to take place on a lasting basis from a physical, social, economic and environmental perspective.</p>

<p>Simplified cultivation techniques are the core component; they are techniques aimed at better soil conservation (or conservation agriculture). Conservation agriculture refers to a set of soil management practices which minimise alteration of the composition, structure and natural biodiversity of soil, safeguarding it against erosion and degradation. These techniques combine surface working techniques, mulch sowing, direct sowing, non-incorporation of crop residues and vegetation cover in forestry (spontaneous vegetation or vegetation resulting from the sowing of appropriate species).</p>

<p>Over and above the purely environmental aspect, the economic aspect of conservation agriculture techniques is another major factor to be taken into account. Cultivation within conventional agriculture calls for a high level of machinery investment and maintenance, a high level of fossil energy consumption and considerable working time by comparison with conservation agriculture. For annual growing without ploughing, for instance, fuel savings over conventional systems are put at three to five litres per ha. In general, conservation agriculture reduces energy consumption by about 15 to 50&#160;%, increasing production per energy unit by 25 to 100&#160;%.</p>

<p>Rural development planning action for 2007 to 2013 affords a unique opportunity to make headway with these techniques. The pilot project could cover know-how dissemination activities, this being a fundamental component of the project. One of the basic objectives is to foster knowledge of these techniques so that future EU legislation can be easily applied.</p>","Pilot project within the meaning of Article 49(6) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1)."

In line with this, the programme will focus on practical help for the end user and in particular children, parents, carers, teachers and educators.</p>

<p>The specific objectives are:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">tackling illegal content and harmful conduct online by supporting actions aiming at reducing the amount of illegal content circulated online and dealing adequately with harmful conduct online, with particular focus on online distribution of child sexual abuse material, grooming and bullying,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">promoting a safer online environment by bringing together stakeholders to find ways to promote a safer online environment and to protect children from content and conduct that may be harmful for them. The aim is to encourage stakeholders to cooperate, take responsibility and develop and implement systems of self-regulation,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">ensuring public awareness by providing contact points where the public and in particular children, parents, carers, teachers and educators can be informed about opportunities and risks related to the use of online technologies and means of staying safe online,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">establishing a knowledge base in order to set up and continue to develop a base for dealing adequately both with existing and emerging uses, risks and consequences, and mapping both quantitative and qualitative aspects in this context. The acquired knowledge will feed into the implementation of the proposed programme as well as into designing adequate actions for ensuring online safety for all users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The programme will seek to involve and bring together the different stakeholders whose cooperation is essential, but who do not necessarily always come together unless the appropriate structures are put in place.</p>

<p>These measures will be implemented by means of the following shared-cost actions:</p>

<ul><li>
<p lang=""en"">pilot projects and best practice actions; ad-hoc projects in areas relevant to the programme, including projects demonstrating best practice or involving innovative uses of existing technology,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">networks and national actions bringing together a variety of stakeholders to ensure action throughout Europe and to facilitate coordination activities and transfer of knowledge,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">Europe-wide investigation carried out on a comparable basis into the way adults and children use online technologies, the resulting risks for children and the effects of harmful practices on children, and behavioural and psychological aspects with emphasis on child sexual abuse related to the use of online technologies, investigation on upcoming risk situations due to transforming behaviours or technological developments, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accompanying measures will contribute to the implementation of the programme or the preparation of future activities. They will include:</p>

<ul><li>

</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">technical assessment of technologies such as filtering designed to promote safer use of the internet and new online technologies,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang=""en"">studies in support of the programme and its actions,</p>
</li>
<li>

There are still 1500 missing persons (Greek Cypriots, Turkish Cypriots and others) and, given that these persons have been considered missing for 35-45 years, there is an urgent need to speed up the work of the CMP, as the number of living relatives of the missing persons and the number of persons who could testify about secret mass graves, etc., is gradually decreasing.</p>","Council Regulation (EC) No 389/2006 of 27 February 2006 establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction (OJ L 65, 7.3.2006, p. 5)."
